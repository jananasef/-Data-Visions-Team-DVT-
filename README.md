This dataset, is designed for retail analytics, covering a vast range of data points relevant to understanding customer behavior, sales trends, product performance, and promotional effectiveness. With over a million rows and 100+ columns, it provides insights for predictive modeling, including total sales (regression) and customer churn (classification). The dataset is structured into nine tables, each serving a unique analytical purpose.

Retail Sales & Customer Behavior Analysis (SQL)
This project focuses on analyzing retail and customer behavior data using SQL queries, targeting performance metrics (KPIs) across multiple domains such as customer behavior, promotions, sales, production, seasonal patterns, and geographic distribution. The analysis is designed to uncover actionable insights that drive business decisions and strategic planning.

**Purpose
The SQL queries in this project are structured to compute a wide range of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across various business aspects. The primary objective is to understand how customers interact with the store, how promotions impact sales, and how performance varies across seasons, products, and locations.

     Key Areas of Analysis
--Customer Insights
    *Calculates customer retention and churn rates to assess loyalty and satisfaction.
    *Computes Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to estimate long-term revenue potential.
    *Performs customer segmentation based on demographics or behavior for targeted marketing.
    *Tracks new vs. returning customers and measures loyalty program effectiveness.

--Customer Behavior Metrics
    *Analyzes average purchase value, frequency, and time since last purchase.
    *Determines discount sensitivity and preferred shopping methods (online vs. in-store).
    *Measures average items per transaction and overall engagement.

--Customer Interaction Data
    *Tracks customer support call frequency to identify service quality and common issues.
    *Measures email subscription rates and app usage levels to gauge digital engagement.
    *Analyzes website visit frequency and social media engagement for marketing impact.

--Promotional Effectiveness
    *Evaluates promotion success rates, conversion rates, and ROI of campaigns.
    *Tracks promotion reach, engagement, and cross-selling or upselling success.
    *Assesses whether discounts and promotions contribute to customer retention.

--Production & Operations
    *Computes production volume, efficiency, and downtime rate.
    *Analyzes defect rates, order fulfillment times, and capacity utilization for operational insights.

--Transactional Insights
    *Measures average transaction value, quantity per transaction, and top-selling categories.
    *Tracks payment method distribution, peak transaction times, and discount usage patterns.

--Sales Performance
    *Calculates total sales per customer, number of transactions, items purchased, and total discounts received.
    *Provides a comprehensive view of individual customer contribution to overall revenue.

--Seasonal Trends
    *Analyzes sales variation across seasons, peak season performance, and inventory turnover.
    *Identifies seasonal demand patterns and evaluates seasonal marketing ROI.

--Geographic Analysis
    *Maps sales, customer density, and revenue across regions and store locations.
    *Tracks return rates, purchase value, and online vs. offline sales by region.
    *Assesses product preferences, store visit frequency, and regional campaign responses.
    *Evaluates delivery times and satisfaction scores to optimize logistics.
